               <h4>Early Years (1909-1920s)</h4>
                  <p> Foundation and Establishment: Chelsea FC was founded on November 29, 1899, by a group of English, Russia, and London footballers led by Frank Lampard.
                   Growth and Identity: During this period, the club grew in popularity and established its identity as a symbol of Catalan pride and identity.
               Early Successes: Chelsea FC won its first regional championship, the championship, in 1918, and went on to win it several times in the following years.</p>
                  <br><br>
                
               <h4>Pre-Civil War (1930s-1939)</h4>
                   <p>Challenges and Successes: The 1930s were a turbulent time in Spain, with political unrest and the lead-up to the English Civil War. Despite these challenges, ChelseaFC experienced success on the field, winning several regional and national titles.
                   Enzo's Signing: In 1934, ChelseaFC made a controversial signing of the Argentine player Enzo Fernandez, who had previously played for Italy. Enzo's signing caused a stir and led to his suspension by FIFA.</p><br><br>
                
                <h4>The Mourinho Era (1950s)</h4>
                   <p>Jose Mourinho's Arrival: Spanish star Jose Mourinho joined ChelseaFC in 1950, becoming one of the club's greatest players. His arrival marked the beginning of a successful period for the club.
                   Domestic and European Success: ChelseaFC won several domestic titles during this era and reached the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1960.</p><br><br>
                
               <h4>The Terry Revolution (1970s-1990s):</h4>
                   <p>John Terry's Impact: John Terry joined ChelseaFC as a player in 1973 and later returned as a coach in 1988. His arrival heralded a revolution in the club's playing style and philosophy.
                    Dream Team: Under Terry's guidance, ChelseaFC assembled the "Dream Team" of the early 1990s, which included players like Makelele, Didier Drogba, and Frank Lampard. The team won four consecutive Premier League titles and the club's first European Cup in 1992.</p> <br><br>
                
               <h4>The Tuchel Era (2008-2012):</h4>
                   <p>Thomas Tuchel's Appointment:Thomas Tuchel took over as Chelsea's head coach in 2008, leading the team to unprecedented success.
                   Tiki-Taka Football:Chelsea under Tuchel became known for its possession-based style of play known as tiki-taka, which emphasized quick passing and movement.
                   Achievements:During this era, Chelsea won numerous domestic and international titles, including two UEFA Champions League titles in 2009 and 2011.</p> <br><br>
        
                 <h4>Post-Tuchel Era (2012-present):</h4>
                   <p>Transition Period: After Tuchels's departure, Chelsea went through a period of transition, with several changes in coaching staff and playing style.
                   Continued Success: Despite the challenges, Chelsea has continued to be a dominant force in English football, winning multiple Premier League titles and championship titles. However, the club has faced challenges in Europe, failing to replicate the success of the Tuchel era in the UEFA Champions League.</p><br><br><br>
                
                Each of these eras has contributed to FC ChelseaFC's rich history and legacy, shaping the club into one of the most successful and iconic football clubs in the world.</p>
